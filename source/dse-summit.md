More information for the Moore and Sloan Data Science Summit in November 2017.

Session at 10:45-11:45am on Monday, Nov 6 in the Riverview 2 room at the New Orleans Mariott.

## Summary

Interpretable machine learning has increased in popularity in the academic community, inspiring DARPA's Explainable AI (XAI) program and a half dozen conferences and workshops. In the first half of the meeting, I'll present the seminal papers in the (young) field and a summary of discussion at the Moore-Sloan Data Science Summit on this topic. In the second half, we can discuss the following as a group: (1) what interpretability has in common with transparency and reproducibility; (2) how transparency can conflict with goals of interpretability; and (3) what the two fields can learn from one another.
