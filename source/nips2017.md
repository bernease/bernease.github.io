### The Promise and Peril of Human Evaluation for Model Interpretability

#### Abstract

Transparency, user trust, and human comprehension are popular ethical motivations for interpretable machine learning. In support of these goals, researchers evaluate model explanation performance using humans and real world applications.  However, these functional measures of interpretability are likely to introduce bias with regard to specific users, applications, and explanation vehicles. Evaluation and optimization using human measures perpetuate implicit cognitive bias in explanations that threaten transparency. We propose two potential research directions to disambiguate cognitive function and explanation models, regaining control over the tradeoff between accuracy and interpretability.
